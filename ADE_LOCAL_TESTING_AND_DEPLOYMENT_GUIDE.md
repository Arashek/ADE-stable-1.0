```

2. Add the following code to your main FastAPI application:
```python
from prometheus_client import make_asgi_app
from fastapi_prometheus_middleware import PrometheusFastApiMiddleware

# Add Prometheus middleware
app.add_middleware(PrometheusFastApiMiddleware)

# Add metrics endpoint
metrics_app = make_asgi_app()
app.mount("/metrics", metrics_app)
```

### 4. Frontend Instrumentation

Add Prometheus instrumentation to the React frontend:

1. Install required packages:
```bash
npm install react-prometheus-metrics
```

2. Add the following code to your React application:
```typescript
import { PrometheusMetrics, createMetrics } from 'react-prometheus-metrics';

const metrics = createMetrics({
  app_load_time: {
    type: 'Histogram',
    name: 'app_load_time',
    help: 'Application load time',
    buckets: [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5],
  },

    help: 'API response time',
    labelNames: ['endpoint', 'method'],
    buckets: [0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5],
  },
});

// Add this to your App component
function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <PrometheusMetrics metrics={metrics} path="/metrics" />
      {/* Rest of your application */}
    </>
