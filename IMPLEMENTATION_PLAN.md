```

This file should be reviewed at the beginning of each development session and updated at the end of each session with progress notes.

## Implementation Guidelines

### Code Standards

- Follow consistent naming conventions across the codebase
- Maintain 80%+ test coverage for all new features
- Document all public APIs and components
- Use typed interfaces for all data structures
- Follow the established architectural patterns

### Review Process

1. Code review required for all PRs
2. Automated tests must pass before merge
3. Design review for UI changes
4. Performance testing for backend changes
5. Security review for authentication/authorization changes

### Integration Process

1. Feature branches should be created from `develop`
2. PRs should target `develop` branch
3. Release candidates created from `develop` to `release`
4. Final releases merged to `main`

## Definition of Done

A task is considered complete when:

1. All acceptance criteria are met
2. Code is reviewed and approved
3. Tests are written and passing
4. Documentation is updated
5. Performance meets established benchmarks
6. No new bugs are introduced
