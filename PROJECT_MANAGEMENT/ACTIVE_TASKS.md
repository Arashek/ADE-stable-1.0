# ADE Platform - Active Tasks

*Last Updated: 2025-04-01*

This document tracks all active tasks for the ADE platform development. It should be reviewed at the beginning of each development session and updated at the end of each session.

## Current Development Phase: Local Testing

The current focus is on getting the ADE platform running locally and testing all functions before proceeding to cloud deployment. The priority is to have ADE create an application based on a prompt, then refine visual aspects and add features.
