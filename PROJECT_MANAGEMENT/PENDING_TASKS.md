# ADE Local Testing Pending Tasks

## Re-Enable Components After Basic Functionality Verification

This document tracks components that have been temporarily disabled to focus on getting the core agent coordination system working locally. These components should be re-enabled systematically once basic functionality is verified.

### Current Status

 Core agent coordination system is now working locally as verified with simplified test script (`core_coordination_test.py`)

### Backend Components

#### Priority 1: Required Dependencies
- [x] Fix relative imports in backend modules
- [x] Create missing models (owner_panel.py, management_components.py)
- [x] Ensure config/settings.py has all required settings
- [x] Verify database connection configuration

#### Priority 2: Owner Panel Components
- [x] Fixed import issues in owner_panel_service.py and owner_panel_db.py
- [x] Added missing auth functions (get_current_admin_user)
- [x] Fixed cache and utility module imports
- [x] Fully re-enable Owner Panel in main.py
- [x] Test Owner Panel basic functionality
- [ ] Verify frontend Admin Dashboard integration with Owner Panel backend
- [ ] Test authentication flow for admin access
- [ ] Implement comprehensive error logging for Owner Panel diagnostics

#### Priority 3: Error Monitoring and Diagnostics
- [ ] Create centralized error logging system for frontend and backend
- [ ] Add structured error capturing in frontend API calls
- [ ] Implement detailed error reporting in backend services
- [ ] Create error visualization dashboard for development
- [ ] Systematically resolve logged errors until components function without errors
- [ ] Document common errors and resolution strategies for deployment reference

#### Priority 3: Monitoring System
- [ ] Restore original monitoring implementation in `services/monitoring/__init__.py`
- [ ] Remove stub implementations of monitoring functions
- [ ] Re-enable metrics middleware in `main.py`
- [ ] Re-enable metrics endpoint in `main.py`
- [ ] Re-enable resource metrics updates in `main.py`
- [ ] Verify Prometheus integration is working correctly
- [ ] Set `ENABLE_METRICS = True` in `config/settings.py` if appropriate for local testing

#### Priority 4: Additional Services
- [ ] Verify all specialized agents are functioning correctly
- [ ] Ensure agent coordination system is handling tasks properly
- [ ] Test memory service functionality

### Frontend Components

- [ ] Verify TypeScript errors are resolved in frontend components
- [ ] Test integration between frontend and backend services
- [ ] Ensure Owner Panel UI is functioning correctly when re-enabled

### Integration Testing

- [ ] Run end-to-end tests with all components re-enabled
- [ ] Verify that ADE can create an app based on a prompt (core functionality)
- [ ] Test visual aspects refinement capabilities
- [ ] Test feature addition workflows

## Implementation Plan for Cloud Deployment

### Phase 1: Local Functionality Validation (Current)
- [x] Implement simplified core agent coordination test
- [x] Verify base specialized agents work correctly
- [ ] Document core component interactions

### Phase 2: Cloud Preparation
- [ ] Identify cloud-specific configuration requirements
- [ ] Update Docker configurations for cloud environment
- [ ] Prepare database migration scripts
- [ ] Create deployment documentation

### Phase 3: Initial Cloud Deployment
- [ ] Deploy core services to cloudev.ai
- [ ] Configure monitoring and logging for cloud environment
- [ ] Perform initial functionality validation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline

## Implementation Notes
When re-enabling components:
1. Re-enable one component at a time
2. Test after each re-enablement to identify any specific issues
3. Fix issues before proceeding to the next component
4. Document any fixes required for future reference

This approach ensures we can systematically restore full functionality while maintaining a stable system that can run locally before proceeding to cloud deployment on cloudev.ai.
