## Architecture Overview

The ADE platform employs a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate to support the entire application development lifecycle. The system is designed around:

1. **Coordination Layer**: Manages communication between agents and orchestrates workflows

4. **Consensus Mechanism**: Resolves conflicts between agent recommendations
5. **Frontend Layer**: User interface components for interacting with the system
6. **Error Management System**: Tracks and analyzes errors across components

### Data Flow

1. User submits requirements through the Command Hub
2. Agent Coordinator processes the request and distributes tasks
3. Specialized agents collaborate on solutions
