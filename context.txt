ADE Platform Development Context - Stable 1.0

This document contains the development context and conversation history for the ADE (AI Development Environment) Platform Stable 1.0 version.

Development History:
1. Initial Setup and Structure
   - Created basic project structure
   - Set up frontend with React and TypeScript
   - Implemented backend services with Python
   - Configured Docker environment

2. Core Features Implementation
   - Code analysis and metrics collection
   - AI-powered development features
   - Real-time collaboration tools
   - Visualization and monitoring systems

3. Type System Development
   - Implemented comprehensive TypeScript types
   - Created interfaces for all major components
   - Added type safety for API interactions
   - Developed type definitions for external libraries

4. Test Loop Implementation
   - Created TestSessionManager for managing test sessions
   - Implemented session isolation
   - Added pause/resume functionality
   - Developed error handling and recovery

Current Status:
- Core functionality is stable and working
- Type system is comprehensive but needs some refinement
- Test loop functionality is in development
- Performance optimization is ongoing

Known Issues:
1. Test loop needs better error handling
2. Some TypeScript type definitions need refinement
3. Performance optimization needed for large codebases
4. Some dependency conflicts in frontend packages

Next Steps:
1. Complete test loop implementation
2. Refine type definitions
3. Optimize performance
4. Enhance error handling
5. Improve documentation

Development Guidelines:
1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Maintain comprehensive test coverage
3. Document all major changes
4. Use conventional commits
5. Review code before merging

Environment Setup:
- Node.js v16 or higher
- Python 3.8+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Cursor IDE (latest version)

API Credentials:
[API credentials have been moved to .env file for security]

Cursor Rules:
1. Use TypeScript for all new code
2. Follow React best practices
3. Implement proper error handling
4. Write comprehensive tests
5. Document all major changes
6. Use meaningful variable names
7. Follow PEP 8 for Python code
8. Maintain type safety
9. Use proper Git workflow
10. Review code before committing
