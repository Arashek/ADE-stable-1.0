## Usage

To use these components:

1. Ensure the UserContext is properly configured
2. Set up the required permissions:
   - `architecture.components.view`
   - `architecture.components.edit`
   - `architecture.components.deploy`
   - `architecture.components.delete`
   - `architecture.components.monitor`
   - `architecture.models.view`
   - `architecture.models.edit`
   - `architecture.models.deploy`

3. Implement the necessary API endpoints for:
   - Component CRUD operations
   - Model management
   - Monitoring data
   - Health checks

## Dependencies
