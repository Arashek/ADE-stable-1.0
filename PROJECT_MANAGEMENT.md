# ADE Platform - Project Management

## Development Process

The ADE platform follows an iterative development process with continuous integration and deployment, focusing on the path to cloud deployment on cloudev.ai. This document outlines the management approach, tracking mechanisms, and communication protocols to ensure consistent progress toward project goals.

## Project Tracking

### Task Management

All tasks are tracked in the following locations:

1. **IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md** - High-level roadmap and sprint planning
2. **PROJECT_MANAGEMENT/ACTIVE_TASKS.md** - Detailed tracking of current tasks with status updates
   - This file should be reviewed at the beginning of each development session
   - It should be updated at the end of each session with progress notes
   - Tasks should be moved to the "Completed Tasks" section when finished

Each task includes:
- Priority level (High, Medium, Low)
- Current status (Not Started, In Progress, Completed, On Hold, Needs Review)
- Task description and subtasks
- Assigned team/individual
- Dependencies
- Estimated completion date
- Progress notes

### Progress Reporting

After each significant development session, an implementation report should be added to the `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORTS` directory with the following format:

```
IMPLEMENTATION_REPORTS/
  YYYY-MM-DD_feature-name.md
```

Each report should include:
1. Summary of changes made
2. Technical decisions and their rationale
3. Challenges encountered and solutions implemented
4. Next steps and recommendations
5. Updated status of relevant tasks

### Version Control

- Feature branches should follow the naming convention: `feature/feature-name`
- Bug fix branches should follow: `fix/issue-description`
- Commit messages should be descriptive and reference task numbers

## Communication Protocols

### Development Sessions

At the start of each development session:
1. Review `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` to understand the overall vision
2. Check `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for current priorities
3. Read recent `IMPLEMENTATION_REPORTS` for context on recent changes

At the end of each session:
1. Update task statuses in `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` and `ACTIVE_TASKS.md`
2. Create an implementation report if significant progress was made
3. Update `CHANGELOG.md` with any user-facing changes

### Decision Making

Major architectural or design decisions should be documented in:
```
ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS/
  YYYY-MM-DD_decision-topic.md
```

Each decision document should include:
1. Context and problem statement
2. Decision drivers
3. Considered options
4. Decision outcome
5. Consequences and trade-offs

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Local Testing & Refinement

During this phase, focus on:
- Completing all specialized agent implementations
- Ensuring proper agent coordination and collaboration
- Testing end-to-end workflows locally
- Refining user interfaces and interactions
- Implementing comprehensive validation systems

**Definition of Done for Phase 1:**
- All specialized agents are fully implemented and integrated
- Agent coordination system enables collaborative decision-making
- End-to-end workflows are tested and validated
- UI/UX is refined and consistent across the platform
- All critical bugs are fixed

### Phase 2: Cloud Deployment Preparation

During this phase, focus on:
- Setting up cloud infrastructure on cloudev.ai
- Implementing user authentication and account management
- Creating database schemas and migrations
- Configuring deployment pipelines
- Implementing security measures for cloud deployment

**Definition of Done for Phase 2:**
- Cloud infrastructure is set up and configured
- User authentication system is implemented and tested
- Database schemas are created and migrations are prepared
- CI/CD pipelines are configured and tested
- Security measures are implemented and validated

### Phase 3: Initial Launch on cloudev.ai

During this phase, focus on:
- Deploying ADE platform to production environment
- Implementing landing page and user onboarding
- Setting up monitoring and logging
- Creating user documentation and tutorials
- Establishing feedback collection mechanisms

**Definition of Done for Phase 3:**
- ADE platform is deployed to production environment
- Landing page and user onboarding are implemented
- Monitoring and logging systems are in place
- User documentation and tutorials are available
- Feedback collection mechanisms are operational

## Quality Assurance

### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for individual components and agents
- Integration tests for agent interactions and coordination
- End-to-end tests for complete application development workflows
- Performance tests for agent response times and system scalability
- Security tests for user authentication and data protection

### Code Review Guidelines

1. Does the code fulfill the requirements?
2. Is the code maintainable and follow established patterns?
3. Are there sufficient tests?
4. Is the documentation adequate?
5. Are there any performance concerns?

## Continuous Improvement

The development process itself should be regularly evaluated and improved:

1. After each sprint, conduct a retrospective
2. Document lessons learned
3. Update processes and guidelines as needed
4. Refine estimation techniques based on actual completion times

## Project Health Metrics

Track the following metrics to assess project health:

1. Velocity: Tasks completed per sprint
2. Quality: Number of bugs reported/fixed
3. Technical debt: Areas requiring refactoring
4. Test coverage: Percentage of code covered by tests
5. Documentation completeness: Percentage of features documented
6. Agent performance: Response times and accuracy of specialized agents
7. User satisfaction: Feedback from initial users during testing
