# Multi-Environment Development Workflow

This document describes the multi-environment development workflow for the ADE Platform project.

## Environment Structure

The project uses three main environments:

1. **Development** (`/environments/development`)
   - Used for active development work
   - Contains development-specific configurations
   - Runs on local development machines
   - Includes debugging tools and development features

2. **Testing** (`/environments/testing`)
   - Used for integration testing
   - Mirrors production environment configuration
   - Runs automated tests
   - Validates changes before production deployment

3. **Production** (`/environments/production`)
   - Used for live deployment
   - Contains production-specific configurations
   - Runs on production servers
   - Optimized for performance and security

## Environment Configuration

Each environment has its own configuration files:

- `.env` - Environment-specific variables and settings
- `docker-compose.yml` - Docker service configurations
- Additional configuration files as needed

## Development Workflow

1. **Development Phase**
   ```bash
   # Start development environment
   cd environments/development
   docker-compose up -d
   
   # Make changes and test locally
   # Run tests
   python -m pytest tests/
   ```

2. **Testing Phase**
   ```bash
   # Sync development to testing
   python scripts/sync_environments.py development testing
   
   # Deploy to testing environment
   python scripts/deploy.py testing
   
   # Run integration tests
   python -m pytest tests/integration/
   ```

3. **Production Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Sync testing to production
   python scripts/sync_environments.py testing production
   
   # Deploy to production
   python scripts/deploy.py production
   ```

## Version Management

The project uses semantic versioning:

```bash
# Bump version
python scripts/version_manager.py bump <major|minor|patch>

# Create release
python scripts/version_manager.py release <major|minor|patch> "Change description"

# Rollback version
python scripts/version_manager.py rollback <version>
```

## Environment Synchronization

The `sync_environments.py` script handles environment synchronization:

- Preserves sensitive values during sync
- Validates configurations
- Creates backups before changes
- Ensures consistency across environments

## Deployment Process

The `deploy.py` script manages deployments:

1. Validates environment configuration
2. Runs test suite
3. Builds Docker images
4. Deploys services
5. Verifies deployment health
6. Provides rollback capability

## Security Considerations

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Development: Uses local development values
   - Testing: Uses test-specific values
   - Production: Uses secure, environment-specific values

2. **Access Control**
   - Development: Open access for development
   - Testing: Limited access for testing
   - Production: Strict access controls

3. **Data Protection**
   - Development: Uses local databases
   - Testing: Uses isolated test databases
   - Production: Uses secure, backed-up databases

## Monitoring and Logging

Each environment includes:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- Structured logging
- Health checks

## Best Practices

1. **Development**
   - Always work in the development environment
   - Run tests before committing changes
   - Keep development environment up to date

2. **Testing**
   - Run full test suite before deployment
   - Validate all configurations
   - Test with production-like data

3. **Production**
   - Follow deployment checklist
   - Monitor deployment health
   - Keep backup and rollback procedures ready

## Troubleshooting

1. **Common Issues**
   - Environment sync failures
   - Configuration mismatches
   - Deployment verification failures

2. **Resolution Steps**
   - Check logs for errors
   - Verify environment variables
   - Validate Docker configurations
   - Use rollback if needed
