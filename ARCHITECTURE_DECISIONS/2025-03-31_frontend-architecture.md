# Architecture Decision Record: Frontend Architecture

**Date:** 2025-03-31  
**Status:** Accepted  
**Deciders:** Development Team  

## Context and Problem Statement

The ADE platform frontend needs a robust architecture that can support complex interactions between different components while maintaining good performance and developer experience. We need to decide on the core architectural patterns and technologies to use.

## Decision Drivers

* Need for a responsive and intuitive user interface
* Requirement to support complex state management across components
* Need for good TypeScript integration for type safety
* Desire for component reusability and maintainability
* Requirement to support AI-assisted features seamlessly

## Considered Options

1. **React with Context API and hooks**
   * Pros: Simple, built into React, good for moderate complexity
   * Cons: Can become unwieldy for very complex state, performance concerns for frequent updates

2. **React with Redux**
   * Pros: Well-established pattern, good for complex state, excellent dev tools
   * Cons: More boilerplate, steeper learning curve, potential over-engineering for simpler features

3. **React with MobX**
   * Pros: Less boilerplate than Redux, reactive programming model
   * Cons: Different paradigm from standard React, potential magic/complexity

4. **React with Zustand**
   * Pros: Minimal boilerplate, hooks-based, good performance
   * Cons: Less established than Redux, smaller ecosystem

## Decision Outcome

**Chosen option: React with Context API for UI state and Zustand for application state**

This hybrid approach gives us the benefits of both worlds:
* Context API for component-specific and UI state that doesn't change frequently
* Zustand for application-wide state that needs better performance and more complex operations

### Technical Implementation Details

1. **Component Structure**
   * Atomic design pattern (atoms, molecules, organisms, templates, pages)
   * Feature-based folder organization
   * Shared components in a common directory

2. **Styling Approach**
   * MUI v5 with styled components API
   * Theme provider for consistent styling
   * Responsive design using MUI's Grid system

3. **State Management**
   * UI state: React Context API
   * Application state: Zustand stores
   * Form state: React Hook Form

4. **Routing**
   * React Router v6 with nested routes
   * Route-based code splitting for performance
   * Protected routes for authenticated sections

## Consequences

### Positive

* Improved developer experience with less boilerplate
* Better performance for complex state updates
* Clearer separation of concerns between UI and application state
* More maintainable codebase with consistent patterns

### Negative

* Learning curve for developers not familiar with Zustand
* Need to be careful about which state goes where
* Potential for inconsistent patterns if not well documented

### Neutral

* Need to establish clear guidelines for when to use Context vs. Zustand
* Regular review of state management approach as application grows

## Related Decisions

* Decision to use TypeScript for type safety
* Decision to use MUI v5 for UI components
* Decision to adopt React 18 for improved performance
