# ADE Cloud Test Phase â€“ Task List

## 1. Infrastructure Readiness
- [ ] Ensure all Kubernetes manifests are present and correct (including Istio and ELK).
- [ ] Confirm Prometheus/Grafana monitoring is fully configured and dashboards are working.
- [ ] Verify MongoDB, Redis, and Prometheus services are set up and accessible in the cluster.
- [ ] Build and push Docker images for all core services (frontend, backend, agents, etc.).

## 2. Application Readiness
- [ ] Confirm frontend (React/Nginx) and backend (API, agents, auth, analytics) build and run in containers.
- [ ] Ensure all environment variables and secrets are managed securely (use Kubernetes secrets/configmaps).
- [ ] Validate WebSocket and real-time features work in the test cloud environment.
- [ ] Smoke test all core APIs and user flows.

## 3. Deployment & Test Automation
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) for automated build, test, and deployment to the cloud test environment.
- [ ] Enable live monitoring and logging dashboards for immediate test feedback.
- [ ] Document deployment and rollback procedures.

## 4. Test & Verification
- [ ] Deploy to a cloud Kubernetes cluster using the provided manifests.
- [ ] Run smoke tests: API, UI, agent coordination, authentication, analytics, and real-time features.
- [ ] Monitor logs and metrics for errors, performance, and stability.
- [ ] Conduct manual and automated tests for all workflows.
- [ ] Validate monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) and logging (ELK stack) are capturing data.

## 5. Feedback & Iteration
- [ ] Document issues, bugs, and improvement areas found during testing.
- [ ] Prepare the repo for rapid iteration and live updates via GitHub (branching, PRs, etc.).
- [ ] Prioritize fixes and improvements based on test results and feedback.

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Check and update all Kubernetes manifests** (especially for Istio and ELK).
2. **Verify monitoring and logging dashboards** are live and collecting data.
3. **Run a full test deployment** in a cloud cluster and execute smoke tests.
4. **Set up CI/CD for live code updates** and automated deployments.
5. **Start documenting issues and improvements** as they are discovered.
