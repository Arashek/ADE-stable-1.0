# ADE Development Rules

## Core Principles
1. **User-Centric Development**
   - All features must enhance user experience and productivity
   - User consultation is mandatory for critical decisions
   - Security and privacy are paramount

2. **Intelligent Automation**
   - Leverage LLM agents for intelligent decision-making
   - Automate routine tasks while maintaining user control
   - Provide clear explanations for automated decisions

3. **Container Management**
   - Ensure isolated, secure development environments
   - Implement efficient resource allocation
   - Support dynamic scaling based on user needs

4. **Security First**
   - Implement comprehensive security monitoring
   - Maintain audit trails for all operations
   - Regular security assessments and updates

5. **Backup and Recovery**
   - Automated backup scheduling
   - Multiple backup locations
   - Quick recovery options
